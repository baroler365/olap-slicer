Value at Risk
the most you are expected to lose with a certain confidence level
e.g. if 5% VaR is $100, that means you are expected to lose at most $100 with a 95% level of confidence
calculation methods: historical method, parametric method (assume normal distribution), Monte Carlo simulation

Stress Testing
analyze how an investment portfolio would reach in certain drastic economic scenarios
historical scenarios: Greece Financial Crisis in 2015, Lehman Brothers Default in 2008, Japan Earthquake & Tsunami in 2011
hypothetical scenarios: Equities down 10% (S&P 500 index), EUR up 10% vs USD
methodology: Monte Carlo simulation

Portfolio Theory
Markowitz Portfolio Theory - risk-adverse investors should maximize expected return for a given level of market risk (variance)
should only buy portfolios on efficient frontier
drawback: variance is not a good risk measurement in practice (use VaR, CVaR instead), highly sensitive to parameter estimation errors (use robust optimization), ignores risk diversification (use risk-parity portfolio)

Equity Valuation
Discounted Cash Flow
Comparable Company Analysis (based on market trading multiples of comparable comp)
Asset Valuation (based on fair value, not book value)

Bond Valuation
present value approach (DCF, using market interest rate)
benchmark against government security and credit rating
arbitrage-free pricing (discounted at same rate as zero-coupon bond)
duration: approximate measure of a bond's price sensitivity to changes in interest rates (If a bond has a duration of 6 years, for example, its price will rise about 6% if its yield drops by a percentage point)
convexity: measures the sensitivity of the bondâ€™s duration to change is yield, measures the curvature
DV01: measures the change in the value of a bond portfolio for every 1 basis point change in interest rates.

Derivatives
futures: obligate the parties to transact an asset at a predetermined future date and price
options: based on underlying securities such as stocks (call: optioin to buy; put: option to sell)
protective put: long stock + long put (insurance policy)
